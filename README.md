# codice-fiscale-ts

A TypeScript library for calculating, validating, and decoding Italian Fiscal Codes (Codice Fiscale).

For an introduction and description in Italian, check out [my blog post](https://blog.bitrey.dev/codice-fiscale-ts).

## Why This Library?

This library was created to address several limitations in existing Italian Fiscal Code libraries:

- üÜï **Automatically Updated Municipalities**: Other libraries like codice-fiscale-js aren't automatically updated when changes are made to the list of municipal cadastral codes. This library uses the [comuni-json](https://github.com/matteocontrini/comuni-json) repository and the [ISTAT API](https://situas-servizi.istat.it/publish/reportspooljson?pfun=61&pdata=01/01/1948) to stay up-to-date.
- üîí **Modern TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions, distinguishing between people born in Italy (`ItalianPerson`) and abroad (`ForeignPerson`).
- ‚ö° **Tree Shaking Support**: Built with modern ES modules to support tree shaking. For validating a fiscal code (`isValidFiscalCode`), the entire library is under 10kB (~5kB with tree shaking enabled)!
- üåê **Standardized Country Codes**: Uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes instead of Italian country names when handling people born abroad.
- üßÆ **Comprehensive Features**: Supports both calculation (personal data ‚Üí fiscal code) and reverse calculation (fiscal code ‚Üí personal data).
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Works in both browser and Node.js environments, with both CJS and ESM support.
- üêõ **Well-Documented and Tested**: Every function is documented, tested, and deterministic.

## Installation

```bash
npm install codice-fiscale-ts
# or
yarn add codice-fiscale-ts
# or
pnpm add codice-fiscale-ts
```

## Usage

### Calculating a Fiscal Code

```typescript
import { calculateFiscalCode, type Person } from "codice-fiscale-ts";

const person: Person = {
  firstName: "Mario",
  lastName: "Rossi",
  birthDate: new Date("1990-01-01"),
  gender: "M",
  birthPlace: "Roma"
};

const fiscalCode = await calculateFiscalCode(person);
console.log(fiscalCode); // RSSMRA90A01H501W (example)
```

### Validating a Fiscal Code

```typescript
import { isValidFiscalCode } from "codice-fiscale-ts";

const isValid = isValidFiscalCode("RSSMRA90A01H501W");
console.log(isValid); // true
```

### Decoding a Fiscal Code

```typescript
import { decodeFiscalCode } from "codice-fiscale-ts";

const decodedData = await decodeFiscalCode("RSSMRA90A01H501W");
console.log(decodedData);
/*
{
  birthDate: new Date('1990-01-01'),
  gender: 'M',
  birthPlace: 'Roma',
  birthProvince: 'RM'
}
*/
```
